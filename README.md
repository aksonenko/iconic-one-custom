Iconic One Custom
=================

This is my customization of the Iconic One Free Theme by Shashank Singh and the
Themonic team. I have made several enhancements to the theme, such as the
responsive social media links at the top, a miniature calendar next to each
post, and lightboxes for images. Overall, the theme is still
recognizable as the Iconic One theme, but has been adapted for use on my
[personal blog](http://g-liu.com/blog).
